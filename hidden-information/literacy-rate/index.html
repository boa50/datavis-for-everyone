                The literacy rate is defined by the percentage of the population that can read and write. (UNESCO)
            </p>
            <p>
                A high literacy rate suggests the existence of an effective primary education system and/or literacy
                programmes that have enabled a large proportion of the population to acquire the ability of using the
                written word in daily life and to continue learning. (UNESCO)
            </p>
            <p>
                However, measuring literacy rates is not always precise. Each country adopts a different method to
                measure, and it might change over time. Some of the most common methods are self-reporting (in which the
                person or the head of the household answers a simple yes or no question to determine literacy) and
                literacy tests (where a standardised test is applied to everyone).
            </p>
            <p>
                Measurements can be biased, though. Surveys can be entirely subjective, depending on how the questions
                are asked and can also make people answer based on cultural pressure. For example, in a country where
                women are not allowed to study, they may be compelled to answer no to this kind of question. And, in our
                modern society, people can be embarrassed to answer that they can't read and, because of that, inflate
                the literacy rate of a particular region.
            </p>
            <p>
                What would you answer if you didn't know how to read and someone asked you the specific question:
                <strong>"Can you read?"</strong>.
